class Scaler():
    """Standardize features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance

    Centering and scaling happen indepently on each feature by computing
    the relevant statistics on the samples in the training set. Mean and
    standard deviation are then stored to be used on later data using the
    `transform` method.

    Standardization of a dataset is a common requirement for many
    machine learning estimators: they might behave badly if the
    individual feature do not more or less look like standard normally
    distributed data (e.g. Gaussian with 0 mean and unit variance).

    For instance many elements used in the objective function of
    a learning algorithm (such as the RBF kernel of Support Vector
    Machines or the L1 and L2 regularizers of linear models) assume that
    all features are centered around 0 and have variance in the same
    order. If a feature has a variance that is orders of magnitude larger
    that others, it might dominate the objective function and make the
    estimator unable to learn from other features correctly as expected.

    Parameters
    ----------
    with_mean : boolean, True by default
        If True, center the data before scaling.

    with_std : boolean, True by default
        If True, scale the data to unit variance (or equivalently,
        unit standard deviation).

    copy : boolean, optional, default is True
        set to False to perform inplace row normalization and avoid a
        copy (if the input is already a numpy array or a scipy.sparse
        CSR matrix and if axis is 1).

    Attributes
    ----------
    `mean_` : array of floats with shape [n_features]
        The mean value for each feature in the training set.

    `std_` : array of floats with shape [n_features]
        The standard deviation for each feature in the training set.
